# linker

## Synopsis

We are creatures of habit. Before smartphones, every morning we would get a cup of coffee, and turn on the same channel, or read the same newspaper sections. Nowadays you turn on your favourite playlists, monitor the stock market, news, or what is on sale. I hope to provide an app where users can access all sorts of specific content in the least number of steps. That is what I hope Linker one day becomes.

Linker is an android application with a goal to give people access to their favourite content in the least number of steps. It is essentially a hub where you can save your favourite reddit links, Spotify playlists, news, etc.

## Getting Started
